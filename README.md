============

This is the archetype used to generate a new project quickly which uses SpringMVC + MyBatis, and the language is Kotlin.

```
$ git clone [project_url]
$ cd quickstart-springmvc-kotlin-mybatis
$ mvn clean install
```

Then you can use your IDE to create your project by choosing this archetype installed locally.
